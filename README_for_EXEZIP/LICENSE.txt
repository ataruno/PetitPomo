# "THE COFFEE-WARE LICENSE"

As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff.  
If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a **coffee ☕** in return.  

No warranty, no guarantees, no refunds — but hey, it’s free coffee-ware.

 Thanks a lot, Poul-Henning Kamp ;)
